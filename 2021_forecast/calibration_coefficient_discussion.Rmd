# Calibration Coefficient Discussion
## Background
Excerpted from Wertheimer et al. 2010:  

"From 1997 to 2007, SECM used the NOAA ship *John N. Cobb* to accrue an 11 year time series of catches with a Nordic 264 rope trawl fished at the surface... (Orsi et al. 2000, 2008)... In 2007, in anticipation of the decommissioning of the *John N. Cobb*, the *Medeia* and the *John N. Cobb* fished synoptically for 28 pairs of trawl hauls to develop calibration factors in the event of differential catch rates between the two vessels (Wertheimer et al. 2008).  In 2008, the *Medeia* fished synoptically with the chartered research vessel *Steller* to determine relative fishing efficiency so that *Steller* catches could then be compared and calibrated to the SECM data series from the *John N. Cobb* (Wertheimer et al. 2009).  In 2009, the commercial trawler *Chellissa* was chartered to fish the SECM transects in the northern and southern regions of Southeast Alaska. The *Medeia* was again fished synoptically in the northern region transects to determine relative fishing efficiency (Table 1)."

One of the primary trawl vessels, F/V *Northwest Explorer*, has not been calibrated and it is assumed to have the same fishing power as the *Chellissa*.', row.names = F)

For the 2021 SEAK pink salmon forecast, there was a discussion as to which vessel calibration coefficient to use going forward. Using the four potential vessel calibration coefficients (pink_cal_mixspecies, pink_cal_mixpool, pink_cal_species, pink_cal_pool; Table 2), the corresponding index of juvenile abundance was slightly different (i.e., CPUE; standardized pink salmon catch based on a 20 minute trawl set by year; Table 3). Performance metrics (Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small sample sizes; AICc values; Burnham and Anderson 2004; mean and median absolute percentage error (MAPE, MEAPE); mean absolute scaled error (MASE) (Hyndman and Kohler 2006)) were used to evaluate forecast accuracy of alternative vessel calibration coefficients (Table 4) using the same model. Statistical analyses were performed with the R Project for Statistical computing version 3.6.3 (R Core Team 2020). The model used for the comparison of the vessel calibration coefficient model was:

$$E(y) = \alpha + \beta_1{X_1} + \beta_2{X_2},$$   

where ${X_1}$ is CPUE, juvenile pink salmon abundance index based on the different vessel calibration coefficients, and ${X_2}$ is the average temperature in Icy Strait in May, June, and July at eight stations in Icy Strait. CPUE data are log-transformed catches that are standardized to an effort of a 20 minute trawl set. The four potential vessel calibration coefficients are defined as:  

pink_cal_mixspecies is a mixture of pink-specific (*Chellisa:Medeia*) and pooled-species (*Medeia:Cobb*) coefficients for the *Chellissa* and the *N/W Explorer*, and a pink salmon coefficient for the *Medeia*. This ends up with a time series that is based on coefficients that vary with species, but are partially derived from a mixture of species-specific and pooled-species coefficients.

pink_cal_mixpool is a mixture of pink-specific (*Chellissa:Medeia*) and pooled-species (*Medeia:Cobb*) coefficients for the *Chellissa* and the *N/W Explorer*, and a pooled-species coefficient for the *Medeia*.

   knitr::kable(format = 'pandoc', caption = 'Calibration coefficients used to convert vessel-specific catches to *Cobb* units. Direct calibrations with the *Cobb* are estimated for the *Steller* and *Medeia*, therefore mixed coefficients are only applied to the *Chellissa* and *NW Explorer*.  Species-specific or pooled-species coefficients could be used as the mixed coefficients for the *Steller* and *Medeia*.', row.names = F)

```
	
## Conclusion
Based on *x,y,and z???*, the discussion was limited to the pink_cal_species and pink_cal_pool vessel calibration coefficients. There is a bit more statistical support for the pink_cal_pool coefficient. As the pool coefficients are currently used for sockeye, coho and Chinook salmon catches, the pink_cal_pool vessel calibration coefficient will be used moving forward for calculating the juvenile pink salmon abundance index.
