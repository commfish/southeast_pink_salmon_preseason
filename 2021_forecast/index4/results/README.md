### Residuals vs. Fitted Plot
The characteristics of an unbiased residual vs. fitted plot and what they suggest about the appropriateness of the simple linear regression model include:  

1) The residuals "bounce randomly" around the 0 line. This suggests that the assumption that the relationship is linear is reasonable;  

2) The residuals roughly form a "horizontal band" around the 0 line. This suggests that the variances of the error terms are equal; and   

3) No one residual "stands out" from the basic random pattern of residuals. This suggests that there are no outliers.

### Residuals vs. Predictor Plots
The interpretation of a "residuals vs. predictor plot" is identical to that for a "residuals vs. fits plot." That is, a "well-behaved" plot will bounce randomly and form a roughly horizontal band around the residual = 0 line. In addition, no data points will stand out from the basic random pattern of the other residuals.
