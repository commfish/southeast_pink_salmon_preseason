# Calibration Coefficent Discussion
For the 2021 SEAK pink salmon forecast, there was a dicsussion as to which vessel calibration coefficient to use going forward. Using the four potential vessel calibration coefficient, the corresponding CPUE (standardized pink salmon catch based on a 20 min trawl set) by year was calcualted. Then, the same model was compared using the four different CPUE variables. The model compared was:

$$E(y) = \alpha + \beta_1{X_1} + \beta_2{X_2},$$

where ${X_1}$ is ln(CPUE+1), based on the different calibration coefficients, and ${X_2}$ is the average temperature in Icy Strait in May, June, and July at eight stations in Icy Strait (Icy Strait and Upper Chatham transects). 

Estimated fishing power coefficients for juvenile salmon catches by the different vessels used during the Southeast Alaska Coastal Monitoring Survey (Wertheimer et al.  2008, 2009, and 2010).

1 -- calculated from estimates for Chellisa:Medeia and Medeia:Cobb.						
2 -- a mixture of species estimates for Chellisa:Medeia and a pooled species estimate for Medeia:Cobb.						
						
						
Calibration coefficients used to convert vessel-specific catches to Cobb units1.						
Vessel	mixed1	mixed2	species	pooled		
Cobb	1.00	1.00	1.00	1.00		
Chellissa	0.66	0.66	0.70	0.74		
NW Explorer	0.66	0.66	0.70	0.74		
Steller	1.05	0.96	0.96	1.05		
Medeia	0.84	0.88	0.88	0.84		
1--direct calibrations with Cobb are estimated for the Steller and Medeia, therefore mixed coefficients are only applied to the Chellissa and NW Explorer.  Species-specific or pooled coefficients could be used as the mixed coefficients for the Steller and Media.
