# Objective
To forecast the Southeast Alaska (SEAK) pink salmon commercial harvest in 2025. This document is for guidance as to what was done for the current forecast year. It is for internal use only. 

# Executive Summary
Forecasts were developed using an approach originally described in Wertheimer et al. (2006), and modified in Orsi et al. (2016) and Murphy et al. (2019), but assuming a log-normal error structure (Miller et al. 2022). This approach is based on a multiple regression model with the raw juvenile pink salmon catch-per-unit-effort (adj_raw_pink; a proxy for abundance), a vessel factor to account for the survey vessels through time, an odd and even year factor to account for potential odd and even year cycles of abundance, and temperature data from the Southeast Alaska Coastal Monitoring Survey (SECM; Piston et al. 2021; ISTI20_MJJ) or from satellite sea surface temperature (SST) data (Huang et al. 2017). The adj_raw_pink variable is not the same as the CPUE variable used in prior years that was adjusted by the pooled-species vessel calibration coefficient for the Cobb and was the maximum average from either June or July (whichever was higher). Instead, the CPUE term used in the 2025 forecast, the adj_raw_pink variable, is the natural logarithm of the maximum untransformed catch, adjusted to a 20 minute haul, from either June or July. The Stellar and Chellissa vessels were only used for one year each, 2008 and 2009, respectively, and so these two years are not used in the assessment (Table 1).

There were 18 individual models considered:

* adj_raw_pink model with a vessel interaction and an odd/even year factor (m1d); 

* adj_raw_pink model with a vessel interaction, an odd/even year factor, and with temperature data from the the SECM survey (m2d);

* 16 adj_raw_pink models with a vessel interaction, an odd/even year factor, and with satellite SST data (m3d-m18d); 

The model performance metrics one-step ahead mean absolute percent error (MAPE) for the last five years (MAPE5; forecast years 2020 through 2024) was used to evaluate the forecast accuracy of the 18 individual models, the AICc values were calculated for each model to prevent over-parameterization of the model, and the adjusted R-squared values, significant terms, and overall p-value of the model were used to the determine fit. Based upon the performance metric the 5-year MAPE, the AICc values, significant parameters in the models, and the adjusted R-squared values, model m11d (a model that included NSEAK_SST_May; Appendix B) was the best performing model and the 2025-forecast using this model has a point estimate of 28.9 million fish (80% prediction interval: 15.7 to 52.9 million fish). 

# Analysis

## Individual, multiple linear regression models
Biophysical variables based on data from Southeast Alaska were used to forecast the harvest of adult pink salmon in Southeast Alaska, one year in advance, using individual, multiple linear regression models (models m1d–m18d). The simplest regression model (model m1d) consisted of the predictor variable juvenile adj_raw_pink $({X_1})$ with a vessel factor interaction $({X_V})$, and an odd/even year factor$({X_B})$. The other 17 regression models (models m2d-m18d) consisted of the predictor variable juvenile adj_raw_pink $({X_1})$ with a vessel factor interaction $({X_V})$, an odd/even year factor $({X_B})$, and a temperature index $({X_2})$. The general model structure was

$$E(Y) = \hat{\beta_0} + \hat {\beta}_{1V}{X_V}{X_1} +\hat {\beta}_{2}{X_2}+\hat {\beta}_{B}{X_B}$$.

The odd/even year factor adjusts the model intercept by $\hat{\beta_0}$ + ${\beta}_{B}$ as ${X_B}$ = 0 for even years (no adjustment to intercept, defaults to model intercept) and ${X_B}$ = 1 for odd years (adjustment for odd years based on ${\beta}_{B}$). The vessel interaction adjusts the model slope. For example, during years when the survey vessel was the Cobb, the slope is adjusted by the $\hat {\beta}_{1COBB}$ which is then multiplied by the adj_raw_pink term in that year.

The temperature index for models m2d-m18d was either the SECM survey Icy Strait temperature Index (ISTI20_MJJ; Murphy et al. 2019) or one of the 16 satellite-derived SST data (Huang et al. 2017). Although the simplest model did not contain a temperature variable, including temperature data with CPUE has been shown to result in a substantial improvement in the accuracy of model predictions (Murphy et al. 2019). The response variable ($Y$; Southeast Alaska adult pink salmon harvest in millions), and the adj_raw_pink (CPUE) data were natural log transformed in the model, but temperature data were not. The forecast $(\hat{\textit {Y}_{i}})$, and 80% prediction intervals (based on output from program R; R Core Team 2023) from the 18 regression models were exponentiated and bias-corrected (Miller 1984),

$$\hat{F_i} = \rm exp (\hat{\textit {Y}_{\textit i}} + \frac{{\sigma_i}^2}{2}),\tag{2}$$

where ${\hat {F_i}}$ is the preseason forecast (for each model $i$) in millions of fish, and $\sigma_i$ is the variance (for each model $i$).

## Performance metric: One-step ahead MAPE
The model summary results using the performance metric one-step ahead MAPE are shown in Table 2; the smallest value is the preferred model (Appendix C). The performance metric one-step ahead MAPE was calculated as follows.

1. Estimate the regression parameters at time $t$-1 from data up to time $t$-1.  

2. Make a prediction of ${\hat{Y_t}}$ at time $t$ based on the predictor variables at time $t$ and the estimate of the regression parameters at time $t$-1 (i.e., the fitted regression equation).  

3. Calculate the MAPE based on the prediction of ${\hat{Y_t}}$ at time $t$ and the observed value of ${Y_t}$ at time $t$,

$$\text{MAPE} = |\frac{\rm exp{(\textit Y_{\textit t})} -\rm exp (\hat{\textit Y_{\textit t}} + \frac{{\sigma_t}^2}{2})}{\rm exp (\textit Y_{\textit t})}|.\tag{3}$$

4.	For each individual model, average the MAPEs calculated from the forecasts,
$$\frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^{n} |\frac{\rm exp{(\textit Y_{\textit t})} -\rm exp (\hat{\textit Y_{\textit t}} + \frac{{\sigma_t}^2}{2})}{\rm exp (\textit Y_{\textit t})}|,\tag{4}$$
where $n$ is the number of forecasts in the average (5 forecasts for the 5-year MAPE and 10 forecasts for the 10-year MAPE). For example, to calculate the five year one-step-ahead MAPE for model m1 for the 2022 forecast, use data up through year 2016 (e.g., data up through year 2016 is $t$ -1 and the forecast is for $t$, or year 2017). Then, calculate a MAPE based on the 2017 forecast and the observed pink salmon harvest in 2017 using equation 3. Next, use data up through year 2017 (e.g., data up through year 2017 is $t$ -1 and the forecast is for year 2018; $t$) and calculate a MAPE based on the 2018 forecast and the observed pink salmon harvest in 2018 using equation 3. Repeat this process for each subsequent year through year 2020 to forecast 2021. Finally, average the five MAPEs to calculate a five year one-step-ahead MAPE for model m1. As the results of the 5-year MAPEs with or without the forecast bias adjustment have been similar (i.e., the model performance order did not change whether the five year one-step-ahead MAPE or the bias-corrected five year one-step-ahead MAPE was compared), for simplicity, the bias adjustment for the forecast was not used in the calculation of the five year one-step-ahead MAPE for model comparison. 

## Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AICc)
Hierarchical models were compared with the AICc criterion. The best fit models, according to the AICc criterion, is one that explains the greatest amount of variation with the fewest independent variables (i.e., the most parsimonious; Table 2). The lower AICc values are better, and the AICc criterion penalizes models that use more parameters. Comparing the AICc values of two hierarchical models, a $\Delta_i \leq 2$ suggests that the two models are essentially the same, and the most parsimonious model should be chosen (Burnham and Anderson 2004). If the $\Delta_i > 2$, the model with the lower AICc value should be chosen. 

# Results 
Based upon the 5-year MAPE performance metric, the AICc values, significant parameters in the models, and the adjusted R-squared values, model m11d (a model that included CPUE (i.e., adj_raw_pink) and the satellite SST variable from northern SEAK in May; Table 1 and Table 2; Appendix C) was the best performing model and the 2025-forecast using this model has a point estimate of 28.9 million fish (80% prediction interval: 15.7 to 52.9 million fish).

# **Variable definitions**
**adj_raw_pink:** First, the raw untransformed catch by year, month, haul, and area was adjusted to a 20 minute haul (raw_pink_catch). Then, these values were log-transformed (i.e., ln(raw_pink_catch + 1). Next, the maximum value in either June or July, whichever month had the highest in a given year, was used as the adj_raw_pink value for the year. Note: the adj_raw_pink value data was not adjusted using vessel calibration factors. This value was used as the 'CPUE' value in the 2025 forecast (i.e., adj_raw_pink = maximum(ln(raw_pink_catch + 1)) in either June or July).

**CPUE:** The average Ln(CPUE+1) for catches in either June or July, whichever month had the highest average in a given year, where effort was a standard trawl haul. The CPUE data was adjusted using vessel calibration factors to account for differences in fishing power among vessels. The last time the CPUE variable was incorporated in the forecasting process was the 2024 forecast.

**ISTI20_MJJ:** The average 20-m integrated water column temperature at the eight stations in Icy Strait (Icy Strait and Upper Chatham transects) sampled during the SECM surveys in May, June, and July of each year (in degrees Celsius).

Figure B1: Bias-corrected forecasts (grey bars) for the 18 regression models with 80% prediction intervals (vertical grey lines). Based upon the performance metrics, the best performing model was m11d. A horizontal dotted line at 20 million fish is placed on the figure for reference only. The 2025-forecast using the model m11d has a point estimate of 28.9 million fish (80% prediction interval: 15.7 to 52.9 million fish).


# Appendix C


## Model Diagnostics
Model diagnostics for model m11d included residual plots, the lack of fit test, and influential observation diagnostics using Cook's distance (Cook 1977), the Bonferroni outlier test, and leverage plots (Table 4; Figure C1; Figure C2). Model diagnostics were used to identify observations that were potential outliers, had high leverage, or were influential (Zhang 2016). 

```{r details}

   knitr::kable(format = 'pandoc', caption = 'Detailed output for model m11d. Fitted values (in millions of fish) are bias-corrected.')
```

### Cook's distance
Cook's distance is a measure of influence, or the product of both leverage and outlier. Cook's distance,
$$D_i=\ \frac{e_{PSi}^2}{k+1}\ast\frac{h_i}{1-h_i},\tag{5}$$				
where $e_{PSi}^2$ is the standardized Pearson residuals, $h_i$ are the hat values (measure of leverage), and $k$ is the number of predictor variables in the model, is a measure of overall influence of the $i_{th}$ data point on all $n$ fitted values (Fox and Weisburg 2019). A large value of Cook's distance indicates that the data point is an influential observation. Cook's distance values greater than $4/(n-k-1)$, where $n$ is the number of observations (i.e., 25), was used as a benchmark for identifying the subset of influential observations (Ren et al. 2016). Therefore, a Cook's distance cut-off of 0.21 was used; observations with a Cook's distance greater than 0.21 may be influential observations (Figure C1a). 

### Leverage
An observation that is distant from the average covariate pattern is considered to have high leverage or hat-value. If an individual observation has a leverage value $h_i$ greater than 2 or 3 times $p/n$ (Ren et al. 2016), it may be a concern (where $p$ is the number of parameters in the model including the intercept (i.e., 6), and $n$ is the number of observations in the model (i.e., 25); $p/n$ = 6/25 = 0.24 for this study). Therefore, a leverage cut-off of 0.48 was used; observations with a leverage value greater than 0.48 may affect the model properties (e.g., summary statistics, standard errors, predicted values) (Figure C1b).

```

Figure C1: Diagnostics plots of influential observations including A. Cook's distance (with a cut-off value of 0.24), and B. leverage values (with a cut-off value of 0.48) from model m11d.

### Influential datapoints
A lack-of fit test was performed between model m11d (full model) and a reduced model with just the adj_raw_pink ('CPUE' term) and vessel interaction term (reduced model). Based on an anova between the full and reduced models, the p-value was less than .05, the null hypothesis of the test is rejected, and it can be concluded that the full model offers a statistically significantly better fit than the reduced model. Diagnostics indicated that one of the data points was above the cut-off value for the Cook's distance (Figure C1a; 2019). One observation had high leverage values (Figure C1b; 2019). Based on the Bonferroni outlier test, none of the data points had studentized residuals with a significant Bonferroni $P$-value suggesting that none of the data points impacted the model fitting; although observation 21 was the most extreme (juvenile years 2019) based on standardized residuals (Figure C2c; Table 5). Based on the lightly curved fitted lines in the residual versus fitted plot (Figure C2d), the fitted plot shows some lack of fit of the model.
