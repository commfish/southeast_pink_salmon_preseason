# Southeast Pink Salmon Preseason Forecast
The NOAA Alaska Fisheries Science Center, Auke Bay Laboratories (NOAA) initiated the Southeast Alaska Coastal Monitoring (SECM; Piston et al. 2020) project in 1997 to better understand the effects of climate and nearshore ocean conditions on year class strength of salmon and ecologically related species (Orsi et al. 1997). Since 2018, the SECM project has been conducted cooperatively by NOAA and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G), and the two agencies have combined efforts to produce a joint pink salmon harvest forecast using SECM data (Piston et al. 2019). The ADF&G research vessel Medeia is now used to conduct the SECM surveys and biologists from NOAA, ADF&G, and the regional aquaculture associations provided direct assistance to the sampling effort during the June, July, and August surveys. In the future, we plan to continue working towards increased coordination between agencies and will continue to look for ways to focus and expand the SECM survey to provide a wide variety of valuable information to the fishing industry.

Current forecasts are developed using an approach described by Murphy et al. 2019.
