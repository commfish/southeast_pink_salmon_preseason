# Objective
To forecast the Southeast Alaska (SEAK) pink salmon commercial harvest in 2023. 

# Executive Summary
Forecasts were developed using an approach originally described in Wertheimer et al. (2006), and modified in Orsi et al. (2016) and Murphy et al. (2019). We used a similar approach to Murphy et al. (2019), but assumed a log-normal error. This approach is based on a multiple regression model with juvenile pink salmon catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE; a proxy for abundance) and temperature data from the Southeast Alaska Coastal Monitoring Survey (SECM; Piston et al. 2021) or from satellite sea surface temperature data (SST and SST Anomaly, NOAA Global Coral Bleaching Monitoring, (https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/NOAA_DHW_monthly.html; https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/NOAA_DHW.html). See the document satellite_SST_process--September_2022 for details about the temperature variables. Based on prior discussions, the index of juvenile abundance (i.e., CPUE) was based on the pooled-species vessel calibration coefficient.

The model performance metric one-step ahead mean absolute precent error (MAPE) for the last five years (years 2018 through 2022) and for the last ten years (years 2013 through 2022) was used to evaluate the forecast accuracy of the 18 individual models. The 2023 forecast was based on model m11; a model that included CPUE and a May temperature index based on northern Southeast Alaska satellite SST data. Based upon this model, the 2023 SEAK pink salmon harvest is predicted to be in the weak range with a point estimate of xxxx million fish (80% prediction interval: xxxx to xxxx million fish). 

# Analysis

## Individual, multiple linear regression models
Biophysical variables based on data from Southeast Alaska were used to forecast the harvest of adult pink salmon in Southeast Alaska, one year in advance, using individual, multiple linear regression models (models m1–m18; Table 1 and Table 2). The simplest regression model (model m1) consisted of only the predictor variable juvenile pink salmon CPUE $({X_1})$, while the other 17 regression models consisted of the predictor variable juvenile pink salmon CPUE and a temperature index $({X_2})$,


$$E(Y_i) = \hat{\alpha}_i + \hat {\beta}_{1_i}{X_1} + \hat{\beta}_{2_i}{X_2}.\tag{1}$$

The temperature index was either the SECM survey Icy Strait temperature Index (ISTI; Murphy et al. 2019) or one of the 16 satellite-derived SST data (Huang et al. 2017). Although the simplest model only contained CPUE, including temperature data with CPUE is likely a more accurate measure of juvenile abundance if temperature affects the proportion of juveniles that migrate through Icy Strait in a given year (Murphy et al. 2019). The response variable ($Y$; Southeast Alaska adult pink salmon harvest in millions) and CPUE data were natural log transformed in the model, but temperature data were not. The forecast $(\hat{\textit {Y}_{i}})$, and 80% prediction intervals (based on output from program R; R Core Team 2021) from the 18 regression models were exponentiated and bias-corrected (Miller 1984),
$$\hat{F_i} = \rm exp (\hat{\textit {Y}_{\textit i}} + \frac{{\sigma_i}^2}{2}),\tag{2}$$

where ${\hat {F_i}}$ is the preseason forecast (for each model $i$) in millions of fish, and $\sigma_i$ is the variance (for each model $i$).

```


## Performance metric: One-step ahead MAPE
The model summary results using the performance metric one-step ahead MAPE are shown in table 2; the smallest value is the preferred model. The performance metric one-step ahead MAPE was calculated as follows.

1. Estimate the regression parameters at time $t$-1 from data up to time $t$-1.  

2. Make a prediction of ${\hat{Y_t}}$ at time $t$ based on the predictor variables at time $t$ and the estimate of the regression parameters at time $t$-1 (i.e., the fitted regression equation).  

3. Calculate the MAPE based on the prediction of ${\hat{Y_t}}$ at time $t$ and the observed value of ${Y_t}$ at time $t$,

$$\text{MAPE} = |\frac{\rm exp{(\textit Y_{\textit t})} -\rm exp (\hat{\textit Y_{\textit t}} + \frac{{\sigma_t}^2}{2})}{\rm exp (\textit Y_{\textit t})}|.\tag{3}$$

4.	For each individual model, average the MAPEs calculated from the forecasts,
$$\frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^{n} |\frac{\rm exp{(\textit Y_{\textit t})} -\rm exp (\hat{\textit Y_{\textit t}} + \frac{{\sigma_t}^2}{2})}{\rm exp (\textit Y_{\textit t})}|,\tag{4}$$
where $n$ is the number of forecasts in the average (5 forecasts for the 5-year MAPE and 10 forecasts for the 10-year MAPE). For example, to calculate the five year one-step-ahead MAPE for model m1 for the 2022 forecast, use data up through year 2016 (e.g., data up through year 2016 is $t$ -1 and the forecast is for $t$, or year 2017). Then, calculate a MAPE based on the 2017 forecast and the observed pink salmon harvest in 2017 using equation 3. Next, use data up through year 2017 (e.g., data up through year 2017 is $t$ -1 and the forecast is for year 2018; $t$) and calculate a MAPE based on the 2018 forecast and the observed pink salmon harvest in 2018 using equation 3. Repeat this process for each subsequent year through year 2020 to forecast 2021. Finally, average the five MAPEs to calculate a five year one-step-ahead MAPE for model m1. For the 10 year one-step-ahead MAPE for model m1, the process would be repeated, but the first forecast year would be 2012.

# Results
The best model based on the 5-year and 10-year one-step ahead MAPE was model m11. 

## Model Diagnostics
Model diagnostics for model m11 included residual plots, the curvature test, and influential observation diagnostics using Cook's distance (Cook 1977), the Bonferroni outlier test, and leverage plots. Model diagnostics were used to identify observations that were potential outliers, had high leverage, or were influential (Zhang 2016). These observations may have significant impact on model fitting and may need to be excluded. 

```{r details}

   knitr::kable(format = 'pandoc', caption = 'Detailed output for model m11. Juvenile years 1998, 1999, 2005, 2012, and 2019, and 2020 (years 1999, 2000, 2006, 2013, 2020, and 2021) show the largest standardized residual. Year refers to the forecast year. Fitted values are log-transformed.')
```

### Cook's distance
Cook's distance is a measure of influence, or the product of both leverage and outlier. Cook's distance,
$$D_i=\ \frac{e_{PSi}^2}{k+1}\ast\frac{h_i}{1-h_i},\tag{5}$$				
where $e_{PSi}^2$ is the standardized Pearson residuals, $h_i$ are the hat values (measure of leverage), and $k$ is the number of predictor variables in the model, is a measure of overall influence of the $i_{th}$ data point on all $n$ fitted values (Fox and Weisburg 2019). A large value of Cook's distance indicates that the data point is an influential observation. Cook's distance values greater than $4/(n-k-1)$, where $n$ is the number of observations (i.e., 25), was used as a benchmark for identifying the subset of influential observations (Ren et al. 2016). Therefore, a Cook's distance cut-off of 0.18 was used; observations with a Cook's distance greater than 0.18 were investigated further (Figure 1a). 

### Leverage
An observation that is distant from the average covariate pattern is considered to have high leverage or hat-value. If an individual observation has a leverage value $h_i$ greater than 2 or 3 times $p/n$ (Ren et al. 2016), it may be a concern (where $p$ is the number of parameters in the model including the intercept (i.e., 3), and $n$ is the number of observations in the model (i.e., 25); $p/n$ = 3/25 = 0.12 for this study). Therefore, a leverage cut-off of 0.24 was used; observations with a leverage value greater than 0.24 were investigated further (Figure 1b).

Figure 1: Diagnostics plots of influential observations including a) Cook's Distance (with a cut-off value of 0.18), and b) leverage values (with a cut-off value of 0.24) from model m11.

### Influential datapoints
To determine if a variable has a relationship with residuals, a lack-of fit curvature test was performed. In this test, terms that are non-significant suggest a properly specified model. The CPUE term was significant in the lack-of-fit curvature test ($P$<0.05), suggesting some lack of fit for this term (Figure 2a). Diagnostics indicated that two of the data points were above the cut-off value for the Cook's distance (Figure 1a). Two observations had high leverage values (Figure 1b). Based on the Bonferroni outlier test, one of the data points had a studentized residual with a significant Bonferroni $P$-value suggesting that one of the data points impacted the model fitting; although observations 2, 3, 9, 16, 23, and 24 and were the most extreme (juvenile years 1998, 1999, 2005, 2012, 2019, and 2020) based on standardized residuals (Figure 3a; Table 5). Based on the lightly curved fitted lines in the residual versus fitted plot (Figure 3b), the fitted plot shows some lack of fit of the model.

Figure 3: a) Standardized residuals versus juvenile year and b) residuals versus fitted values for model m11. Positive residuals indicate that the observed harvest was larger than predicted by the model.


The best regression model based on the performance metric one-step ahead MAPE was model m11 (i.e., the model containing CPUE, and a May NSEAK SST data). The adjusted $R^2$ value for model m11 was 0.79 (Table 2) indicating overall a good model fit. Based upon a model that includes juvenile pink salmon CPUE and May NSEAK SST (model m11), the 2023 SEAK pink salmon harvest is predicted to be in the weak range with a point estimate of xxxx million fish (80% prediction interval: xxxx to xxxx million fish).
