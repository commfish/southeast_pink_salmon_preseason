# Objective
The overall objective is to test a variety of temperature variables, using satellite sea surface temperature (SST) data or Southeast Alaska Coastal Monitoring project (SECM) data, within the forecasting model framework to forecast the 2022 pink salmon harvest in southeast Alaska (SEAK). This write-up is a summary of available SST variables based on satellite data (i.e., average of May (May), the average over the months of May through July (MJJ), the average over the months of April through June (AMJ), or the average over the months of April through July (AMJJ) from 1997 through 2021) over four regions of SEAK; Icy Strait, Icy and Chatham Straits, northern southeast Alaska (NSEAK), and SEAK. This write-up also includes a summary of SECM survey data from various months (i.e., the average over the months of May, June, and July (MJJ)) at 20 m depths of the SECM transects (i.e., Icy Strait and Upper Chatham transects stations ISA, ISB, ISC, ISD, UCA, UCB, UCC, UCD) from 1997 through 2021. 

# Methods
## Satellite-derived SST data
Satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) data from April 1997 through June 2021 were pulled from the 'SST and SST Anomaly, NOAA Global Coral Bleaching Monitoring, 5km, V.3.1, Monthly, 1985-Present' time series (https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/NOAA_DHW_monthly.html; full citation in references). The monthly data for July 2021 from the site https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/NOAA_DHW_monthly.html was not available at the time of the assessment, so the daily data (https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/NOAA_DHW.html; full citation in references) was summarized by month and region, and then combined with the monthly data from April 1997 through June 2021 to create the SST dataset (April 1997 through July 2021). This satellite-derived SST data set was then matched to pre-determined coordinates from four spatial regions that corresponded with sixteen variables of interest (four regions; four temporal variables per region). 

### Satellite-derived SST variables
**Icy_Strait_SST_May**: The Icy Strait region encompasses waters of Icy Strait from the east end of Lemesurier Island to a line from Point Couverden south to Point Augusta. This variable is the average SST in May (Table 1; Figure 1; Figure 5a).

**Icy_Strait_SST_MJJ**: The Icy Strait region encompasses waters of Icy Strait from the east end of Lemesurier Island to a line from Point Couverden south to Point Augusta. This variable is the average SST in May through July (Table 1; Figure 1; Figure 5b).

**Icy_Strait_SST_AMJ**: The Icy Strait region encompasses waters of Icy Strait from the east end of Lemesurier Island to a line from Point Couverden south to Point Augusta. This variable is the average SST in April through June (Table 1; Figure 1; Figure 5c).

**Icy_Strait_SST_AMJJ**: The Icy Strait region encompasses waters of Icy Strait from the east end of Lemesurier Island to a line from Point Couverden south to Point Augusta. This variable is the average SST in April through July (Table 1; Figure 1; Figure 5d).

**Chatham_SST_May**: The Chatham and Icy Straits region encompasses waters of Chatham and Icy Straits east of Lemesurier Island to Point Couverden, and south to the approximate latitude of 56.025 degrees north (roughly Cape Decision off Kuiu Island) (Figure 2 and Figure 5a; Table 2). This variable is the average SST in May.

**Chatham_SST_MJJ**: The Chatham and Icy Straits region encompasses waters of Chatham and Icy Straits east of Lemesurier Island to Point Couverden, south to the approximate latitude of 56.025 degrees north (roughly Cape Decision off Kuiu Island) (Figure 2 and Figure 5b; Table 2).

This variable is the average SST in April through July.

**NSEAK_SST_May**: The NSEAK region encompasses northern Southeast Alaska from 59.475 to 56.075 degrees north latitude (approximately Districts 9 through 15, and District 13 inside area only; northern Southeast Inside subregion for Southeast Alaska (NSEI); Figure 3 and Figure 5a; Table 3). This variable is the average SST in May. 

**NSEAK_SST_MJJ**: The NSEAK region encompasses northern Southeast Alaska from 59.475 to 56.075 degrees north latitude (approximately Districts 9 through 15, and District 13 inside area only; northern Southeast Inside subregion for Southeast Alaska (NSEI); Figure 3 and Figure 5b; Table 3). This variable is the average SST in May through July.

**NSEAK_SST_AMJ**: The NSEAK region encompasses northern Southeast Alaska from 59.475 to 56.075 degrees north latitude (approximately Districts 9 through 15, and District 13 inside area only; northern Southeast Inside subregion for Southeast Alaska (NSEI); Figure 3 and Figure 5c; Table 3). This variable is the average SST in April through June.

**NSEAK_SST_AMJJ**: The NSEAK region encompasses northern Southeast Alaska from 59.475 to 56.075 degrees north latitude (approximately Districts 9 through 15, and District 13 inside area only; northern Southeast Inside subregion for Southeast Alaska (NSEI); Figure 3 and Figure 5d; Table 3). This variable is the average SST in April through July.

**SEAK_SST_May**: The SEAK region encompasses Southeast Alaska from 59.475 to 54.725 degrees north latitude (Figure 4 and Figure 5a; Table 4). This variable is the average SST in May.

**SEAK_SST_MJJ**: The SEAK region encompasses northern Southeast Alaska from 59.475 to 54.725 degrees north latitude (Figure 4 and Figure 5b; Table 4). This variable is the average SST in May through July.

**SEAK_SST_AMJ**: The SEAK region encompasses Southeast Alaska from 59.475 to 54.725 degrees north latitude (Figure 4 and Figure 5c; Table 4). This variable is the average SST in April through June.

**SEAK_SST_AMJJ**: The SEAK region encompasses Southeast Alaska from 59.475 to 54.725 degrees north latitude (Figure 4 and Figure 5d; Table 4). This variable is the average SST in April through July.

## SECM survey temperature data
SECM survey temperature data were summarized by year (1997 to 2021), month (average over the months of May, June, and July) at 20m depths for the Icy Strait and Upper Chatham transects combined.

### SECM survey temperature variables

**ISTI20_MJJ**: Average temperature in the upper 20m during May through July at 8 stations in Icy Strait (Icy Strait and Upper Chatham transects; Figure 1; Figure 6; Table 5).
