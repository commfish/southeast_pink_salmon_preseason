# Objective
The overall objective is to optimize temperature variables by testing a variety of reasonable options using satellite data or Southeast Alaska Coastal Monitoring project (SECM) data within the forecast model framework. This would allow us to better evaluate our options and decide whether or not a variable change in the 2022 forecast model for SEAK pink salmon is warranted. This write-up is a summary of available sea surface temperature (SST) variables based on satellite data (average of May (May), the average over the months of May, June, and July (MJJ), the average over the months of April through June (AMJ), or the average over the months of April through July (AMJJ) from 1997 through 2020) over four regions of Southeast Alaska (SEAK); Icy Strait, Icy and Chatham Straits, northern southeast Alaska (NSEAK), and SEAK. This write-up also includes a summary of SECM survey data from various months (the average of May or the average over the months of May, June, and July), and depths (i.e., 3m, 10m, 15m, 20m) of the SECM transects (Icy Strait and Upper Chatham transects stations ISA, ISB, ISC, ISD, UCA, UCB, UCC, UCD or the Icy Strait transect stations ISA, ISB, ISC, ISD) from 1997 through 2020. 

# Methods
## Satellite-derived SST data
Satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) data were pulled from the 'SST and SST Anomaly, NOAA Global Coral Bleaching Monitoring, 5km, V.3.1, Monthly, 1985-Present' time series (https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/NOAA_DHW_monthly.html; full citation in references). This satellite-derived SST data set was then matched to pre-determined coordinates from four regions that corresponded with sixteen variables of interest (four regions; four variables per region). 

### Satellite-derived SST variables
**Icy_Strait_SST_May**: The Icy Strait region encompasses waters of Icy Strait from the east end of Lemesurier Island to a line from Point Couverden south to Point Augusta. This variable is the average SST in May.

**Icy_Strait_SST_MJJ**: The Icy Strait region encompasses waters of Icy Strait from the east end of Lemesurier Island to a line from Point Couverden south to Point Augusta. This variable is the average SST in May through July.

This variable is the average SST in April through July.

This variable is the average SST in May through July.

**NSEAK_SST_AMJ**: The NSEAK region encompasses northern Southeast Alaska from 59.475 to 56.075 degrees north latitude (approximately Districts 9 through 15, and District 13 inside area only; northern Southeast Inside subregion for Southeast Alaska (NSEI); Figure 3 and Figure 6c; Table 3). This variable is the average SST in April through June.
