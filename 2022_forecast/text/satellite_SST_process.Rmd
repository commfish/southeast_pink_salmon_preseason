# Objective
The overall objective is to optimize temperature variables by testing a variety of reasonable options using satellite data or Southeast Alaska Coastal Monitoring project (SECM) data within the forecast model framework. This would allow us to better evaluate our options and decide whether or not a variable change in the 2022 forecast model for SEAK pink salmon is warranted. This write-up is a summary of available sea surface temperature (SST) variables based on satellite data (average of May, the average over the months of May, June, and July, or the average over the months of April through July from 1997 through 2020) in five regions of Southeast Alaska (SEAK); Icy Strait, Chatham Strait, northern southeast Alaska (NSEAK), SEAK, and a region that is in close proximity to the Icy Strait transect from the SECM survey (SST_Jordan). This write-up also includes a summary of SECM survey data from various months (the average of May or the average over the months of May, June, and July), and depths (i.e., 3m, 10m, 15m, 20m) of the SECM transects (Icy Strait and Upper Chatham transects stations ISA, ISB, ISC, ISD, UCA, UCB, UCC, UCD or the Icy strait transect only) from 1997 through 2020. 

# Methods
## Satellite-derived SST data
Satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) data were pulled from the 'SST and SST Anomaly, NOAA Global Coral Bleaching Monitoring, 5km, V.3.1, Monthly, 1985-Present' time series (https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/NOAA_DHW_monthly.html; full citation in references). This satellite-derived SST data set was then matched to pre-determined coordinates from five regions (Icy_Strait, Chatham_Strait, NEAK, SEAK, and SST_Jordan) that corresponded with fifteen variables of interest (five regions; three variables per region). 

### Satellite-derived SST variables
**Icy_Strait_SST_May**: This variable is similar to the Icy Strait Temperature Index (i.e., ISTI3_May in Figure 7a and Figure 8a) and is meant to replicate May sampling that occurs from vessels in Icy Strait during the SECM surveys (Icy Strait and Upper Chatham transects; stations ISA, ISB, ISC, ISD, UCA, UCB, UCC, UCD), a migration pinch point for salmon in Southeast Alaska (Piston et al., 2021; Figure 1; Figure 6a; Figure 8a; Table 1). The Icy Strait Temperature Index (i.e., ISTI3_May) is defined as the average May temperature at 3m at the Icy Strait and Upper Chatham Stations of the SECM survey. 

**Icy_Strait_SST_MJJ**: This variable is similar to the Icy Strait Temperature Index (i.e., ISTI3_MJJ in Figure 7b and Figure 8a) and is meant to replicate May through July sampling that occurs from vessels in Icy Strait during the SECM surveys (Icy Strait and Upper Chatham transects; stations ISA, ISB, ISC, ISD, UCA, UCB, UCC, UCD), a migration pinch point for salmon in Southeast Alaska (Piston et al., 2021; Figure 1; Figure 6b; Figure 8a; Table 1). The Icy Strait Temperature Index (i.e., ISTI3_MJJ) is defined as the average May, June, and July temperature at 3m at the Icy Strait and Upper Chatham Stations of the SECM survey. 

**Icy_Strait_SST_AMJJ**: This variable is meant to replicate sampling that occurs from vessels in Icy Strait during the SECM surveys (Icy Strait and Upper Chatham transects; stations ISA, ISB, ISC, ISD, UCA, UCB, UCC, UCD), a migration pinch point for salmon in Southeast Alaska (Piston et al., 2021; Figure 1; Figure 6c; Table 1). The SECM surveys do not sample in April. This variable is the average April through July sea surface temperature and covers a similar area to the Icy Strait Temperature Index.

**Chatham_Strait_SST_May**: The Chatham Strait region encompasses waters of Chatham Strait from the northern tip of Admiralty Island (approximately 58.425 degrees latitude north) to the approximate latitude of 56.025 degrees north (roughly Cape Decision off Kuiu Island) (Figure 2 and Figure 6a; Table 2). This variable is the average SST in May over the Chatham Strait region.

**Chatham_Strait_SST_MJJ**: The Chatham Strait region encompasses waters of Chatham Strait from the northern tip of Admiralty Island (approximately 58.425 degrees latitude north) to the approximate latitude of 56.025 degrees north (roughly Cape Decision off Kuiu Island) (Figure 2 and Figure 6b; Table 2). This variable is the average SST in May through July over the Chatham Strait region. 

**Chatham_Strait_SST_AMJJ**: The Chatham Strait region encompasses waters of Chatham Strait from the northern tip of Admiralty Island (approximately 58.425 degrees latitude north) to the approximate latitude of 56.025 degrees north (roughly Cape Decision off Kuiu Island) (Figure 2 and Figure 6c; Table 2). This variable is the average SST in April through July over the Chatham Strait region. 

**NSEAK_SST_May**: The NSEAK region encompasses northern Southeast Alaska from 59.475 to 56.075 degrees north latitude (approximately Districts 9 through 15, and District 13 inside area only; northern Southeast Inside subregion for Southeast Alaska (NSEI); Figure 3 and Figure 6a; Table 3). This variable is the average SST in May over the NSEAK region. 

**NSEAK_SST_MJJ**: The NSEAK region encompasses northern Southeast Alaska from 59.475 to 56.075 degrees north latitude (approximately Districts 9 through 15, and District 13 inside area only; northern Southeast Inside subregion for Southeast Alaska (NSEI); Figure 3 and Figure 6b; Table 3). This variable is the average SST in May through July over the NSEAK region.

**NSEAK_SST_AMJJ**: The NSEAK region encompasses northern Southeast Alaska from 59.475 to 56.075 degrees north latitude (approximately Districts 9 through 15, and District 13 inside area only; northern Southeast Inside subregion for Southeast Alaska (NSEI); Figure 3 and Figure 6c; Table 3). This variable is the average SST in April through July over the NSEAK region.

**SEAK_SST_May**: The SEAK region encompasses Southeast Alaska from 59.475 to 54.725 degrees north latitude (Figure 4 and Figure 6a; Table 4). This variable is the average SST in May over the SEAK region. 

**SEAK_SST_MJJ**: The SEAK region encompasses northern Southeast Alaska from 59.475 to 54.725 degrees north latitude (Figure 4 and Figure 6b; Table 4). This variable is the average SST in May through July over the SEAK region.

**SEAK_SST_AMJJ**: The SEAK region encompasses Southeast Alaska from 59.475 to 54.725 degrees north latitude (Figure 4 and Figure 6c; Table 4). This variable is the average SST in April through July over the SEAK region.

**SST_Jordan_May**: This region is meant to replicate sampling of the Icy Strait transect (stations ISA, ISB, ISC, ISD) during the SECM survey (Figure 5; Figure 6a; Figure8b; Table 5). This variable is the average SST in May over the SST Jordan region.

**SST_Jordan_MJJ**: This region is meant to replicate sampling of the Icy Strait transect (stations ISA, ISB, ISC, ISD) during the SECM survey (Figure 5; Figure 6b; Figure 8b; Table 5). This variable is the average SST in May through July over the SST Jordan region.

**SST_Jordan_AMJJ**: This region is meant to replicate sampling of the Icy Strait transect (stations ISA, ISB, ISC, ISD) during the SECM survey (Figure 5; Figure 6c; Table 5). This variable is the average SST in April through July over the SST Jordan region.
