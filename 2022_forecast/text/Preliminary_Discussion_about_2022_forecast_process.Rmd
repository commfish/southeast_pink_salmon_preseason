# Objective
To determine the process for the 2022 Southeast Alaska (SEAK) preseason pink salmon forecast using data through 2020. 

# Executive Summary
Forecasts were developed using an approach originally described in Wertheimer et al. (2006), and modified in Orsi et al. (2016) and Murphy et al. (2019). We used a similar approach to Murphy et al. (2019), but assumed a log-normal error. This approach is based on a multiple regression model with juvenile pink salmon catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) and temperature data from the Southeast Alaska Coastal Monitoring Survey (SECM; Murphy et al. 2020) or satellite sea surface temperature data (SST and SST Anomaly, NOAA Global Coral Bleaching Monitoring, 5km, V.3.1, Monthly, 1985-Present’ time series (https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/NOAA_DHW_monthly.html). Based on prior discussions, the index of juvenile abundance (i.e., CPUE) was based on the pooled-species vessel calibration coefficient.

Leave-one-out cross validation (hindcast) and model performance metrics were used to evaluate the forecast accuracy of models. These metrics included Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AICc values; Burnham and Anderson 2004), the mean absolute scaled error (*MASE* metric; Hyndman and Kohler 2006), the weighted mean absolute percentage error (*wMAPE*; based on the last 5 years), leave one out cross validation *MAPE* (*MAPE_LOOCV*), and significant coefficients (i.e., covariates) in the model.

# Analysis
## Hierarchical models
Forty five hierarchical models were investigated. The full model was:

$$E(y) = \alpha + \beta_1{X_1} + \beta_2{X_2} + \beta_3{X_1X_2},$$

where ${X_1}$ is the average CPUE for catches in either the June or July survey, whichever month had the highest average catches in a given year, and was based on the pooled-species vessel calibration coefficient, ${X_2}$ is a temperature index, and $\beta_3$ is the interaction term between CPUE and a temperature index. The CPUE data were log-transformed in the model, but temperature data was not. The simplest model did not contain a temperature variable (model m1 or 1). None of the interactions were significant (see Appendix); therefore only additive models (23 models) were considered further.

## Performance Metrics
The model summary results using the performance metrics AICc, *MASE*, *wMAPE*, and *MAPE_LOOCV* are shown in Table 2. For all of these metrics, the smallest value is the preferred model. Models with  $\Delta_i$AICc $\leq$ 2 have substantial support, those in which 4 $\leq$   $\Delta_i$AICc $\leq$  7 have considerably less support, and models with  $\Delta_i$AICc > 10 have essentially no support (Burnham and Anderson 2004). The performance metric *MAPE* was calculated as

$$MAPE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^{n} |\frac{A_t-F_t}{A_t}|$$
where $A_t$ is the observed values and $F_t$ are the predicted values. The performance metric *wMAPE* was calculated as

$$wMAPE =\sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{1}{w_t} \sum_{t=1}^{n} |\frac{A_t-F_t}{A_t}|w_t.$$
The AICc in Table 2 is the AICc value and not the $\Delta_i$AICc. The performance metric AICc suggests that models m19 and m13 are the recommended models. The performance metrics *MASE* and *MAPE_LOOCV* suggest that models m16, m22, m19 and m13 are the recommended models. The performance metric *wMAPE* suggests that models m20, m16, m22, and m19 are the recommended models.

Figure 1: The 2021 SEAK pink salmon harvest (millions) forecast by model. The 80% prediction intervals (corrected for log transformation bias in a linear-model) around each forecast were calculated using the car package (Fox and Weisberg 2019) in program R (R Core Team 2020). The dotted horizontal line is the average forecast across all models. The SEAK pink salmon harvest in 2021 (based on the November 18, 2020 advisory announcement) was a point estimate of 28 million fish (80% prediction interval: 19–42 million fish).
