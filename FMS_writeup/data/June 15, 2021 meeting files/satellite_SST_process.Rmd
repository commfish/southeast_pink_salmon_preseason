# Objective
The overall objective is to optimize temperature variables by testing a variety of reasonable options using satellite sea surface temperature (SST) data or Southeast Alaska Coastal Monitoring project (SECM) data within the forecast model framework. This write-up is a summary of available SST variables based on satellite data (i.e., average of May (May), the average over the months of May, June, and July (MJJ), the average over the months of April through June (AMJ), or the average over the months of April through July (AMJJ) from 1997 through 2020) over four regions of Southeast Alaska (SEAK); Icy Strait, Icy and Chatham Straits, northern southeast Alaska (NSEAK), and SEAK. This write-up also includes a summary of SECM survey data from various months (i.e., the average of May (May) or the average over the months of May, June, and July (MJJ)), and depths (i.e., 3m, 10m, 15m, 20m) of the SECM transects (i.e., Icy Strait and Upper Chatham transects stations ISA, ISB, ISC, ISD, UCA, UCB, UCC, UCD) from 1997 through 2020. 

# Methods
## Satellite-derived SST data
Satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) data were pulled from the 'SST and SST Anomaly, NOAA Global Coral Bleaching Monitoring, 5km, V.3.1, Monthly, 1985-Present' time series (https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/NOAA_DHW_monthly.html; full citation in references). This satellite-derived SST data set was then matched to pre-determined coordinates from four spatial regions that corresponded with sixteen variables of interest (four regions; four temporal variables per region). 

### Satellite-derived SST variables

This variable is the average SST in May. 

**NSEAK_SST_MJJ**: The NSEAK region encompasses northern Southeast Alaska from 59.475 to 56.075 degrees north latitude (approximately Districts 9 through 15, and District 13 inside area only; northern Southeast Inside subregion for Southeast Alaska (NSEI); Figure 3 and Figure 5b; Table 3). This variable is the average SST in May through July.
